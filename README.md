The original driver source code for the PowerVR Series 1 GPUs : Midas arcade, PCX1 and PCX2. This source code is provided as a reference, without any guarantees that it will compile, or function correctly when compiled.

### *Special Note*

As of right now, due to licensing concerns we have been unable to supply some libraries and headers provided by SciTech Software for "The Universal VESA VBE" However, this was only used for the Tomb raider port, in order to tell the PCX hardware the details of the framebuffer.
